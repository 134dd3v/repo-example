# About Harpie

Harpie identifies malicious transactions by having users set up a "trusted network" of protocols and peers. If your wallet sends a transfer to someone outside this trusted network, we stop that transaction from happening.

We are able to eliminate these malicious transfers even after they're transmitted on-chain with an advanced strategy called frontrunning. When a malicious transfer or approval is detected, we move your funds to a noncustodial vault before the transaction can confirm. By paying a higher gas fee, we have the ability to move your funds to the vault before the hacker can move your funds to their own wallet.
